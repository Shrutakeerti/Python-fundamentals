Try creating a small program that calculates the factorial of a number provided by the
user. This will help reinforce your understanding of loops and conditional statements.

def factorial(n):
 if n == 0:
 return 1
 else:
 return n * factorial(n-1)
# Taking user input
num = int(input('Enter a number: '))
print(f'The factorial of {num} is {factorial(num)}')

Enter a number: 5
The factorial of 5 is 120
