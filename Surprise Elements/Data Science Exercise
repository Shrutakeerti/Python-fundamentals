Here's a quick data science exercise. Calculate the mean of a list of numbers provided
by the user.


def calculate_mean(numbers):
 return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
# Taking user input
user_input = input('Enter numbers separated by spaces: ')
numbers = list(map(int, user_input.split()))
print(f'The mean of the numbers is {calculate_mean(numbers)}')

Enter numbers separated by spaces: 1 2 3
The mean of the numbers is 2.0
