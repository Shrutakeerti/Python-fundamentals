Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept
of 'objects', which can contain data and code.


# Defining a class
class Dog:
 def __init__(self, name, age):
 self.name = name
 self.age = age
 def bark(self):
 return 'Woof!'
# Creating an object
my_dog = Dog('Buddy', 3)
print(my_dog.name) # Output: Buddy
print(my_dog.bark()) # Output: Woof!

Buddy
Woof!
